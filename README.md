# TwitterCopyCat

**Description:** My first android app while learning Android development concepts. Its funcionality is similar to Twitter. The user has a timeline with public tweets and can send 140 caracters tweets.

**Current state:** Right now, the app doesn't work properly because its dependent on obsolete URL to get and publish tweets.

**Basic Funcionalities:**

- Login with a username and password;
- Send 140 caracters tweet;
- ... [todo]
